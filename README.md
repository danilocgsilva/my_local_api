Sometimes, you will need access apis that you don't would like to allow in some public domain. So here we have an easy way to setup locally endpoints apis, with your secret key running locally.

## How to use

1. Install the utility, going to the root directory and running the following command:

`pip install .`

2. Just execute in any location:

`mylocalapi`

This will rise a local http data provider that can be consumed anytime locally.
